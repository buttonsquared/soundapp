This app will let Sound dudes sync the audio to the video when doing sound effects.  The app needs to detect if a white light goes and 
if there is a pop noise.  To discover the white light we capture frames from the camera and do a luminocity calculation.  
To do the sounds we check to see if decibel level has changed.  

Also there is a decible meter
